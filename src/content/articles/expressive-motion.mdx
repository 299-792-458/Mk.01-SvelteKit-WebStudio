	Motion is the connective tissue between intention and interaction. When used with care it
	transcends decoration and becomes guidance, storytelling, and delight.

We approach motion like we approach typography: as a system. It requires scales, tokens, choreography guidelines, and tooling that makes the right move the default move.

## Building a Motion Spec

1. **Define the palette** – duration, easing, choreography principles.
2. **Prototype in isolation** – each motion preset lives inside a Storybook canvas for rapid QA.
3. **Instrument everything** – motion events trigger analytics pings to understand sentiment.

## Interaction Modes

- **Cinematic** for large screen hero experiences.
- **Tactile** for product UI and micro interactions.
- **Ambient** for background loops that set tone.

### Toolkit

```ts
import { timeline } from 'motion';

timeline([
	['.hero-headline', { opacity: [0, 1], y: [40, 0] }, { duration: 0.8 }],
	[
		'.hero-orbs',
		{ scale: [0.6, 1], filter: ['blur(12px)', 'blur(0px)'] },
		{ at: '<', duration: 1.6 }
	]
]);
```

In the final stage we stress test for reduced motion and extreme viewport widths, ensuring accessibility never takes a back seat to aesthetics.
