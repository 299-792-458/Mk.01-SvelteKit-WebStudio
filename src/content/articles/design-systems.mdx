Design systems are not just component libraries—they are cultural agreements that let teams move faster without sacrificing craft.

## Foundations

- **Tokens first** to unify spacing, typography, and motion semantically.
- **Accessibility baked in** with linting pipelines and governance dashboards.
- **Composable documentation** using MDX, Storybook, and interactive playgrounds.

### Governance Snapshot

```json
{
  "component": "Button",
  "a11y": {
    "aria": true,
    "contrast": true,
    "focusRing": true
  },
  "usage": {
    "productTeams": 8,
    "marketingTeams": 3
  }
}
```

## Enablement

1. Weekly crits to review patterns and exceptions.
2. Async office hours for engineers to request component enhancements.
3. Quarterly audits mapping design debt and measuring adoption.

Systems thrive when they empower teams to bend rules responsibly, not when they enforce rigid templates.
