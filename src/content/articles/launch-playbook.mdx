Launching is choreography. Every step—from early prototypes to final QA—must be intentional so the audience feels the magic without sensing the chaos behind the scenes.

## Pillars

- **Narrative first** — Align story arcs, voice, and CTA orchestration with business goals.
- **Motion as language** — Document entrance timings, state changes, and progressive disclosure.
- **Resilience** — Build fallback experiences and automate regression checks for every route.

### Motion Timeline

```ts
const heroReveal = timeline([
  [
    ".hero-headline",
    { opacity: [0, 1], y: [30, 0] },
    { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOutCubic" },
  ],
  [
    ".hero-media",
    { scale: [0.92, 1], filter: ["blur(12px)", "blur(0px)"] },
    { at: "<", duration: 1.2 },
  ],
]);
```

## QA Rituals

1. Automated visual regression with multiple theme snapshots.
2. Performance budgets enforced via Lighthouse CI.
3. Manual run-through with screen readers and reduced-motion settings.

The deliverable? A reusable launch playbook that meets marketing, product, and engineering expectations while delighting users.
